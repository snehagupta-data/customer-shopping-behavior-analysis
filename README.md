# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping behavior to identify <b>key revenue drivers</b>, <b>customer loyalty patterns</b>, and <b>purchasing trends</b>.
The objective is to generate <b>actionable business insights</b> that help improve <b>customer retention</b> and <b>overall revenue growth</b>.

## Dataset Summary
- <b>Total Customers:</b> 3,900+
- <b>Total Revenue:</b> $233K+

---

## Business Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:
- Identify <b>high-value customer segments</b>
- Analyze the <b>impact of subscriptions and discounts</b> on customer spending
- Understand <b>loyalty and repeat purchase behavior</b>
- Evaluate how <b>demographics (age, gender, location)</b> influence purchases
- Determine <b>top-performing products, categories, and sizes</b>

---

## Tools & Technologies Used
- <b>SQL</b> – Data extraction, joins, aggregations, and filtering
- <b>Python (Pandas, Matplotlib)</b> – Data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis
- <b>Power BI</b> – Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling
- <b>Excel / CSV</b> – Dataset storage and preprocessing

---

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
The following steps were performed to prepare the data for analysis:
- Removed <b>missing, duplicate, and inconsistent values</b>
- Standardized <b>categorical variables</b> (payment method, shipping type, purchase frequency)
- Created <b>derived features</b>:
  - Purchase frequency (in days)
  - Customer loyalty indicators
  - Revenue metrics by customer segment
- Merged multiple datasets using <b>SQL joins</b>

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted using <b>Python and SQL</b> to understand:
- Revenue distribution across customer segments
- Purchase frequency patterns
- Product and category-level performance
- Subscription vs non-subscription behavior

Key insights identified during EDA were later visualized using <b>Power BI</b>.
